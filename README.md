# Pac Man Exercise
This is an exercise where a pac man is animated to move back and forth across a screen

# Explanation
This project is a result of an assignment provided by MIT XPro. This assignment practices fundamental JavaScript skills making use of:
- Using parameters in functions
- Coding logic to loop through items in an array
- Scheduling execution based on events on a web page

# Roadmap for Future Improvements
To elaborate on this project I would like to animate pacman to enable the user to deposit food for pacman upon a mouse click. Next step would be to deposit food that is at random either garbage or food. If pacman eats garbage pacman turns a deeper shade of green. If pacman eats good food pacman returns to yellow. If pacman eats too much garbage, then pacman turns grey and rotates becomes motionless. Game over.
